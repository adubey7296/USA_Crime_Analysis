 #### Description
 Trying to detect specific patterns of crime and criminal behavior is extremely challenging. Crime analysts can spend countless hours sifting through data to determine whether a crime fits into a known pattern and to discover new patterns. Once a pattern is detected, the information can be used to predict, anticipate and prevent crime.

This movement towards more empirical, data-driven approaches — also called predictive policing — is growing across the country. The U. S. Department of Justice and the National Institute of Justice both recently launched initiatives to support predictive policing and it has gained a lot of attention in the news.

However, the work of crime analysts to detect specific patterns of crime committed by the same individual or group (“crime series”) largely remains a manual task. The automated tools available to police currently don’t have the capability to find specific patterns of crime. They can only estimate background crime levels (how much crime might be in a certain area at a certain time). To find specific patterns, analysts must manually review crime reports and compare them to past crimes.
